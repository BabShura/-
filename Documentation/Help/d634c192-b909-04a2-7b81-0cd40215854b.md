With Ninject, your type bindings are collected into groups called modules. Each of these modules represents an independent segment of your application. They can be organized as you see fit in order to segregate your system into subsystems in a way that makes your overall architecture easy to grok. Modules just need to implement the INinjectModule interface, but most should extend the NinjectModule class for simplicity.</td></tr></table>&nbsp;
