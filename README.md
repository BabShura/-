# RiotApi.NET
> (WORK IN PROGRESS)


This is a .net Api for Riot Games League of Legends written in C#. The goal of this ptoject is to provide a higher 
level of interaction with the Riot's API Rest service, json responses are deserialized to objects and all methods of the
service are called via an Interface with all supported methods as documented by Riot.

In other words this project is a simple C# client with no special configuration or magic tricks, only an api key
is needed!
