The goal of this ptoject is to provide a higher \r\nlevel of interaction with the Riot's API Rest service, json responses are deserialized to objects and all methods of the\r\nservice are called via an Interface with all supported methods as documented by Riot.\r\n\r\nIn other words this project is a C# wrapper client that can be used within any kind of .net application or any other application using .net mono framework.\r\n\r\n#How to use\r\nThe usage of the RiotApi.Net is a piece of cake! In less than three lines of code you can retrieve any data\r\nfrom Riot's services. \r\nFor instance you can fetch all free to play champions and print them to screen as you can see in the following example.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nusing RiotApi.Net.RestClient.ApiCalls;\r\nusing RiotApi.Net.RestClient.Configuration;\r\nusing RiotApi.Net.RestClient.Interfaces;\r\n\r\n//initialize Champion api with your riot api key\r\nIChampion championApi = new Champion(\"your api key here\");\r\n//retrieve all current free to play champions\r\nvar championList = championApi.RetrieveAllChampions(RiotApiConfig.Regions.NA, freeToPlay:true);\r\n//print the number of free to play champions\r\nConsole.WriteLine($\"There are {championList.Champions.Count()} free to play champions to play with!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nresponse => There are 17 free to play champions to play with!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide .net application developers with a high level tool for Riot games' API \r\nto use in their apps. I hope you will like it!
